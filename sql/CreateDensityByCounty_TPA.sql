/*
Repost of the goal below. Because many parcels are in TPA's 
but not in the growth footprints, by using just the footprint tables above, 
we can't determine what 2040 or 2015 counts look like. 
So, we restate the goal, and back out whats needed.

GOAL:
3.       Quantify by County the:
a.       2015 and 2040 Dwelling Units per acre within TPAs
b.       2015 and 2040 Employment/Jobs per acre within TPAs
4. Quantify by County the acres of overlap between the Preferred Scenarioâ€™s (proposed Plan) land use footprint and transportation footprint.

For example:

County|Residential Units in TPA's in 2015|Residential Units in TPA's in 2040|
------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
Alameda|300|400|
Marin|100|100|

total_residential_units is sourced from the "Diff" table so it doesn't give us either of the above directly. 
however, we can back the values for 2015 out of the subtraction of the diff values from the 2040 counts.

so, we'll insert that logic below and then output the summary table as spec'ed above.
