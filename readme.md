## Goal

The goal of this repository is to output summary tables and geospatial feature classes in support of Plan Bay Area and the associated Environmental Impact Report. 

## Data Sources

Data used for the EIR process in general is in a spreadsheet [here](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/203423564244) mapping figures to data sources, metadata, and paths via a data_id, which is based upon the "Row ID" in the following [smartsheet](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=kxHiygtZYYFSoNxKdR-2Ww) that was used to track work for the EIR in process. 

Data used in the scripts in this repository is mainly sourced from the outputs MTC's implementation of [UrbanSim](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim).   

## Folders  

### [data](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/UrbanSim_Spatial_Analysis/tree/master/data)  

This is where Extract, Transform, and Load scripts and smaller CSV files live.   

### [docs](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/UrbanSim_Spatial_Analysis/tree/master/docs)  

This is where output files structured as documents (PDFs) live.  

### [sql](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/UrbanSim_Spatial_Analysis/tree/master/sql)  

These SQL scripts are used to summarize Land Use data. Please see the README in that folder for further documentation.  

### [esri](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/UrbanSim_Spatial_Analysis/tree/master/esri)   

SDE connections, Pro documents, and Toolboxes live here.
